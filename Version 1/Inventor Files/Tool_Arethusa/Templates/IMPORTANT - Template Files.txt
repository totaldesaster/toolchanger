IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THOSE USING MULTIPLE LANGUAGE PACKS

Applies to:
 - Anyone installing multiple language packs and keeping the default template installation location (C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor release year\Templates).
 - Anyone storing and using custom templates in the C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor release year\Templates folder.

Inventor has supported language packs for many releases. This allowed you to install multiple languages onto
a single Inventor installation and switch between them via the Start Menu shortcut (which uses a /language parameter).  

Although the language packs would install localized template files, launching different languages of Inventor wouldn't 
actually change which templates were used by default. 

With Inventor 2020 all language packs are installed and handled the same. There is no longer a need to copy the templates to the
parent folder because the template file path is updated when you change languages. This simplifies use and maintenance of templates,
whether default or custom.
