L profile		Doesn't matter too much - random bits I had laying around...

Printed parts:
I'd recommend printing all mechanical parts with at least 4 walls and 25% Infill. I used Extrudr PLA NX2 for mine, any decent quality filament should work.

If you designed heads or dock bases for your printer, feel free to share them!
